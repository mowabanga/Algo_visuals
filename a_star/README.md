"...a King is born in Jerusalem tonight" - 3 wise men after seeing A Star outside Jerusalem.
To imagine the carnage the statement caused. The infanticide that ensued thereafter.

Unlike the 3 wise men, we won't be making any statements that might end up having babies murdered. What we'll infact do is most probably fry our brains trying to learn of the A* (a-star) algorithm, its use cases and what on earth a heuristic function is; in the comments on the code.

A* Algorithm - is one of the most popular if not best path-finding algos. Basically, it computes               the shortest path between two nodes(starting node and end node)

USE CASES:
    - Parsing using Stochastic grammers in NLP(Natural Language Processing)
    - Moving NPC(Non-Playable Characters) in Video Games
    - Route planning(think of Uber)
    - Logistics(think of DHL)
    - Robotics(think of Sophia the robot)

So how does it exactly work? Think of a square grid, say 16x16, we have our start node the left side and end node on the right side. In between are obstacles randomly placed. The purpose of the algo will be to find the shortest path through the obstacles. Remember that the shortest path is the optimal path.
