This repo contains an attempt at visualizing all major algos.

Special attempt has been made to dumbing down the code to the point it might be possible to explain some of this code snippets to a 5 yo. Okay, I'm lying, but as you'll realize, a lot of the codes here will be super easy.

A lot of the work entailed in this repo is very much plagiarized, so I'll try and name the original developers(who I very much know might also have plagiarized from other devs, I call it the circle of devs, and it's okay, really.)

For the sake of simplicity, I'll alternate between Python and vanilla Javascript, you might note I'm heavily biased and hence Python will outweigh JS, but life is not fair.
